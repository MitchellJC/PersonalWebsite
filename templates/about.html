              This course introduces the student to design and development
              practices for multimedia content, focusing particularly on web
              sites. Modern design practices for the web are taught, framed by
              an introduction to human-centred design techniques, particularly
              heuristic based interface design guidelines for web interfaces and
              web accessibility from a global perspective. Today's web sites
              need to be both well designed and dynamic, thus the course also
              introduces some basic scripting techniques for going beyond static
              content. The focus of learning is activity based and incorporates
              both individual and team based exercises.

              The concept of computation is one of the central ideas in computer
              science. In this course, we will explore why the current
              generation of computing hardware is designed the way it is and
              show that computation is possible outside the natural realm of
              computers we have today. The course will introduce the grand
              unified theory of computation based on Turing machines, recursive
              functions, Lambda calculus and cellular automation. It will
              present the Church-Turing thesis to show that all these models are
              all equivalent. The theory of computation based on Turing machines
              will also include an introduction to finite state machines and
              their role in constructing regular languages. The course will also
              briefly introduce quantum computation and its applications. The
              necessary mathematical preliminaries in will be covered during the
              course.
