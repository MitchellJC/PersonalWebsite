          Advanced Calculus & Linear Algebra I (MATH1071)
        </span>
        <p class="course-description">
          1. Elementary linear algebra: Vectors, linear independence, scalar
          product. Matrices, simultaneous equations, determinants, Gaussian
          elimination, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, applications. Equation of
          straight line & plane. 2. Introduction to proof-based calculus:
          Fields, sequences, limits, continuity, intermediate and extreme value
          theorems, maxima & minima. 3. Techniques of calculus: Series,
          differentiation, integration, numerical methods, Taylor series,
          L'Hopital's rule. This course differs from MATH1051 by treating
          material in more depth and with greater rigour.
